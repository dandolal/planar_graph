# planar_graph

This code checks if graph is planar or not using gamma-algorithm. To find a description of this algorithm follow this link: https://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC  
Input format: 2 numbers n - number of vertices and m - number of edges, m pairs of numbers - vertices connected with an edge. Vertex numbering starts with 0.  
Output format: "This graph is/is not planar"
