# planar_graph

This code checks if graph is planar or not. We use gamma-algorithm. A description of this algorithm: https://neerc.ifmo.ru/wiki/index.php?title=%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B0-%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BC  
Input format: the number of vertices, the number m of edges and m pairs of numbers-vertices connected by an edge. Vertex numbering starts with 0.  
Output format: "This graph is/is not planar"

The program is created as part of the "Discrete structures and algorithms in topology" course by A.B.Skopenkov at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. Website of the course: https://www.mccme.ru/circles/oim/home/combtop13.html.
